It looks like you want to "make a directory" structure for that comprehensive electrician's tool list!
Here is how you would use the mkdir command to instantly organize those categories into a clean file system structure on your computer. This is great for organizing inventory lists, safety documentation, or standard operating procedures (SOPs).
The Command
You can do this in one line using the brace expansion {} feature (common in Bash/Zsh) and the -p (parents) flag.
mkdir -p Electrician_Tools/{Core_Hand_Tools,Testing_Measurement,Power_Tools,Specialty_Installation,PPE,Job_Specific}

What this creates
Running that command will generate the following folder structure instantly:
Electrician_Tools/
├── Core_Hand_Tools/
├── Testing_Measurement/
├── Power_Tools/
├── Specialty_Installation/
├── PPE/
└── Job_Specific/

Going Further: Populating the Folders
If you wanted to create empty inventory files for specific tools inside those folders, you could combine touch with your new directories:
# Create inventory files in the PPE folder
touch Electrician_Tools/PPE/{gloves_insulated.txt,hard_hat.txt,arc_flash_suit.txt}

# Create inventory files in the Power Tools folder
touch Electrician_Tools/Power_Tools/{drill_driver.txt,sawzall.txt,angle_grinder.txt}

Would you like to see how to list all these new files and folders recursively using the ls -R or tree command?
